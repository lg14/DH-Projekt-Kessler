               <placeName type="write" key="49097">Ascot</placeName> July 4 1881</p>
            <p>This morning we drove away at 9 and started for the Devils Punch bowl which is about
               22 miles off; there was one big brake in which I was and 2 smaller ones but as all
               the boys could not get in <persName key="760">M<hi rend="ul.2">
                     <hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
                  </hi> Kynnersley</persName> and 6 boys had to go in another carriage. It was very
               hot being 92 Farh. in the shade and 120 in the sun. It took us rather more than 4
               hours to get to the place as none of the drivers knew the way and we were hardly
               rewarded for the squash by 2 or 3 fine views into Surrey. When we got there we had a
               picnick. G! but what a picnick! without a bit of shade there we sat in the broiling
               sun drinking dirty tepid water which had been brought from the next inn which was a
               mile off in an old tin kettle which had come from <placeName key="49097">Ascot</placeName> with us trailing on the ground without a lid and which was
               consequently full of dust. However it was better than nothing and so we were quite
               content with that as it was quite a relief from the boiling ginger beer and ale which
               we had had before. We had tea at an inn as our diner experiences had not been very
               pleasant..There was a murder committed at the Punch bowl there is a cross to mark the
               place, a mound to mark the gallons and a stone and inscription to mark the spot was thrown into the
                  <placeName>punch bowl</placeName>. I had the courage to go to the bottom of it and
               was rewarded by finding some pummistone. We saw the comet which was very bright while
               coming home and rejoiced our ears by having &#x201e;<name type="work" key="36566">Grandfather&#x2019;s clock</name>&#x201c;<note type="reg">
                  <persName key="18848">Work</persName>
               </note> and ghost stories bawled into them</p>
