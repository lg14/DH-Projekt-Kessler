            <p> We started up to <placeName key="49050">London</placeName> by the 8.35 up train. We
               arrived at Waterloo at about 9.30. The Head<note type="reg">
                  <persName key="667">Sneyd-Kynnersley</persName>
               </note> had hired some S. W railway busses by the day, for 15/-<note type="com">15 Schilllings</note> each to drive about
               in. We first had ourselves jolted to the Baker street bazaar where we arrived in
               rather the worse for wear or rather shaking, for the coachman, a cadaverous looking
               person, seemed to take great pleasure in driving up all &#x201e;impasses&#x201c; and into all the
               rocks he could possibly think of or find. I suppose he was the conductor of a funeral
               car and was perhaps in hopes that the shaking might be fatal to one of the more
               delicate of our party and that he might be the driver of the funeral car. However we
               did arrive at Baker street without being quite turned upside down. After that we
               jolted on to the Zoo where we saw Jumbo. He eat a great many buns but ungratefully
               rejected the sack which we gave him. We saw the others fed and and went into a small
               house where we saw some &#x201e;armadilloes.&#x201c; We then drove to <persName key="1117">M<hi rend="ul.2">
                     <hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  </hi> Bald&#x2019;s</persName> to have dinner. We sat over dinner till so late that we
               got to the theatre 20 minutes too late. We saw two pieces: &#x201e;<name type="work" key="28513">Dearer than life</name>&#x201c;<note type="reg">
                  <persName key="18871">Byron</persName>
               </note> and &#x201e;<name type="work" key="28514">Domestic economy</name>&#x201c;<note type="reg">
                  <persName key="18872">Lemon</persName>
               </note>. In the latter a labourer who was keeping his shop while his wife was out was
               very rude to his customers: he sent herrings and tallow candles after them and told
               one who complained how sticky the brandyballs were that it was because his son sucked
               them and put them back into the box. We afterwards drove to the South-Kensington<note type="reg">
                  <orgName key="66795">Victoria and Albert Museum</orgName>
               </note>; we saw the &#x201e;Rocket&#x201c; the first steam engine ever made and the same which ran
               over <persName key="18852">Huskisson</persName> there. We did not get back to
                  <placeName key="49097">Ascot</placeName> till a quarter to ten.</p>
