                  Thursday.</p>
            <p> Choir expedition. We started for <placeName key="48973">Portsmouth</placeName> by
               the 8.57 train. At <placeName key="48930">Woking</placeName> we had to change. We got
               to <placeName key="48973">Portsmouth</placeName> at about 1 o&#x2019;clock and immediately
               went on board. It was raining hard all the time we were on the boat and from time to
               time we shipped some heavy seas; We saw the &#x201e;Victory&#x201c;, the frigate <persName key="8345">Nelson</persName> was killed on, in <placeName key="48973">Portsmouth</placeName> harbour. As soon as we got to <placeName key="48974">Ryde</placeName> we went to the station and went to <placeName key="48975">Shanklyn</placeName>. At <placeName key="48975">Shanklyn</placeName> we
               immediately took a &#x2019;buss and drove to the <orgName key="66810">Chine Hotel</orgName>
               where we unpacked our hampers and had dinner as it was too wet to picnic on the
               beach. After dinner we went down to the beach and up the cliffs to the Chine which is very beautiful; there is a high cascade
               and on each side of this cascade are huge rocks overgrown with green. When we got
               down on to the beach again we were attacked by a photographer who would insist upon
               photographing us; the group was pretty good and I ordered two copies. After being
               photographed we bathed. The sea was rather rough and we were frightfully knocked
               about; after my bath I had some trouble in getting the sand out of my feet. After
               this we immediately had tea; then I went down town and got some photographs and by
               this time it was so late that we nearly missed the train, especially as the coachman
               suddenly stopped and asked whether <persName key="706">Mortimer mi.</persName> was
               inside the carriage. At the station we bought a large basket of strawberries for 3
               shillings. On our way back we saw a great many soldiers at all the stations we passed
               evidently going to the war. At <placeName key="49050">London</placeName> we got the
                  <name type="periodical" key="70795">Evening Standard</name> which had nothing but that a
               Rising was expected in <placeName key="48976">Ireland</placeName>, and that the
               English ships at <placeName key="48977">Alexandria</placeName> were being cleared for
               action, while the French government had ordered its ships to withdraw. We got home at
               about half past eleven.</p>
