                  Thursday.</p>
            <p> General expedition. We started for <placeName key="48978">Frimley</placeName> at
               11.15 a.m. As soon as we got there we walked towards the woods to look out for a nice
               place for picknicking; and we discovered a place which looked all right although
               there was no wasps or ants nest nice and handy whose inhabitants might come and help
               us at our dinner. There was about an hour before dinner so I and <persName key="911">Pearse</persName> had a stroll in some very nice woods and some very nasty
               thorns. As soon as we saw the dinner cart we went to help to lay the table. And as
               soon as this was done we began dinner. After dinner <persName key="667">M<hi rend="ul.2">
                     <hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  </hi> Kynnersley</persName> and some other fellows went a long walk and did not
               come back in time for tea. I and those fellows who did not go with the Head<note type="reg">
                  <persName key="667">Sneyd-Kynnersley</persName>
               </note> made a bonfire
               and played rounders. It was at this stage of the proceedings that we were innocently
               trespassing. At about 5½ the alarm was given that we had no time to spare if we
               wanted to catch the train. So we ran and bustled, and I left the <persName key="667">Head&#x2019;s</persName> stick behind and got a fly into my eye and breathlessly rushed
               into the station and discovered that we were just half an hour early. We spent the
               time in laying pennies and pins on the line. As soon as we got home I ran up to the
               playroom and saw the drop scene which is now finished and looks very well. Further
               massacers expected in <placeName key="48979">Egypt</placeName> at <placeName key="48980">Cairo</placeName>.</p>
