            <head>4.11.1882 Samstag</head>
            <p>
               <placeName type="write" key="49069">Hamburg</placeName>. November. 4. 1882</p>
            <p> Ball at the <persName key="1165">Schröders</persName>. Went to the hairdresser to have my hair arranged a little.
               He pomatomed, and washed, and cosmetiqued it till I might have used it instead of an
               umbrella, and then rubbed it with a very ill looking and smelling towel. <persName key="856">Aunt Lulu</persName> came to fetch me when I was dressed and off I went
               to the Schröders. As soon as I got there I was introduced to and asked to dance with
               a whole row of girls, with awful names, in the right sense of the word, who were
               sitting around the room bolt upright not saying a word, and I was very glad to find
               some old aquaintances. <persName key="1166">Asher</persName> was there, looking
               rather more skeletonly, if such a thing is possible, than ever, did not know a soul,
               did not want to know a soul, didn&#x2019;t want to dance (because he was afraid of breaking
               his shirt front); the truth is that he could not find anybody to dance with him on
               account of his looks: everybody called him the bat, and one of his most marvellous
               feats was his serving of the cream with his fingers. I danced a good deal with
                  <persName key="1153">Belle Haspberg</persName>, who is very nice; but the
               prettiest girls there were the Busse&#x2019;s<note type="reg">
                  <persName key="1609">Alice</persName>, <persName key="4199">Berta</persName>, <persName key="73084">Frieda</persName>, <persName key="1225">Lilly</persName> und <persName key="4692">Mary</persName>
               </note> who looked sweet. I took <persName key="1153">Belle</persName> to dinner and after dinner, as the piano player had
               gone away, one of us began playing; but it was impossible to dance to this music, and
               so little idea had the boy of how a waltz ought to be played that he went off into a
               polka; in trying to dance to this beautiful potpoury I distinguished myself by
               sprawling down with <persName key="1168">the little Schröder</persName>. And after
               this feat I went away after a very pleasant evening. I drove to <persName key="856">aunt Lulu&#x2019;s</persName>, to sleep there, so as not to keep the Blümers<note type="reg">
                  <persName key="1163">Auguste</persName> u. <persName key="1162">Wilhelm</persName>
               </note> up the whole night. <persName key="856">Aunt Lulu</persName> was still up;
               and I went to bed in her stranger&#x2019;s-room.</p>
