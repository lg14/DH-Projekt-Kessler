               <placeName type="write" key="49096">Paris</placeName>. January 6. 1883. Saturday.</p>
            <p>Drove to the rue de Rivoli where we arrived at 9. <persName key="176">Papa</persName>
               and I stopped downstairs in the arcades where we bought sundry photographies of
                  <persName key="9594">Gambetta</persName>. It was really amazing to see where the
               crowd had got to. One man had got on to one of the flower pots which form part of the
               railings of the Tuileries. How he got up is a mystery. But how he got down is not as
               he did that pretty precipitately owing to being nearly suffocated by the smoke of a
               chimney which opened just under him. At about a quarter to ten we went up to
                  <persName key="1221">Misses Keogh&#x2019;s</persName>, and at the same time some
               &#x201e;cantonniers&#x201c; began pelting the people with sand, by way of clearing the road. And
               they really did hit some people on the head with it. At about 10.30 the Garde de
               Paris turned the corner of the Rue de Rivoli, followed by some policemen to clear the
               way, a by no means easy operation. Then followed the deputations of Alsace-Lorraine
               with some very fine flowers, after them came some pompes funèbres à cheval, then
               three carriages each drawn by four horses covered with flowers. On each side of these
               carriages walked sixteen men, in black knee breeches and with a silver chain around
               their necks, two and two each pair carrying two huge wreathes on sticks; and behind
               came a single man carrying an enormous wreath too. After this came some soldiers, and
               then the hearse. The hearse was made of a low kind of truck with enormous silver
               wheels. On this truck stood the lower part of the catafalque of the rue de Bourbon
               without the columns and dais; at each corner of the catafalque were antique incense
               burners covered over with crape. On the catafalque stood the coffin in a tricolore
               flag, with an enormous piece of velvet, half covering it and falling down nearly to
               the ground at the back of it. Then came some more Alsace Lorraine people, and a lot
               of freemaçons; there was also a deputation from <placeName key="48992">Martinique</placeName> with about twenty niggers, and a deputation from
               <placeName key="78359">Algeria</placeName> with some splendid flowers. At the sight of
               anything prettier than the rest the people cried "bis, bis". Among other things a
               large triangle of violets was conspicuous as well as a flag bearing an English
               inscription, something about french brethren, and liberty, equality fraternity. The
               flowers were magnificent. After all these deputations, among almost every one of
               which were women and among some like the freemasons children, came the garrison of
                  <placeName key="49096">Paris</placeName> and <placeName key="48884">Versailles</placeName> which closed the procession. In the afternoon I drove to
               the Palais Bourbon to see the decorations. A large piece of crape, 150 meters long
               they say, was draped across the whole front and the background was formed by black
               woollen stuff draped on the wall behind the columns, decorated with flags and palms.
               Between the columns stood large silver candlesticks and the whole staircase was
               covered with wreathes and flowers. The <name type="work" key="36620">statue of
                  Strasburg</name>
               <note type="reg">
                  <persName key="80960">Pradier</persName>
               </note> was draped in black but not the lanterns. The steps were covered with
               wreathes. Played with <persName key="104">Gee</persName> the rest of the afternoon,
               and went away tonight.</p>
