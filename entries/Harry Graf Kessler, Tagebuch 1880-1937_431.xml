               </note>. June 3. 1884. Wednesday</p>
            <p>Started from <placeName key="49069">Hamburg</placeName> at 8.22 this morning. Arrived
               here at 2. Had table d&#x2019;hote then went down to the promenade and got two horses.
                  <persName key="856">Aunt Lulu</persName> took two men and a stone to get her on.
               We went to the top of the Burgberg with the column<note type="reg">
                  <persName key="24">Unbekannt</persName>, <name key="36627" type="work">Canossa-Säule</name>
               </note> with &#x201e;Nach Canossa gehen wir nicht&#x201c; on it and the two
               Walküren. From there we went through the most beautiful forest to the Rabenklippen
               from where we had a beautiful view of the Brocken. Then we rode on to the Sennhütte
               got off near the Philosophenweg and walked home by it. There is a fearful storm while
               I am writing this. It is pouring. I hope it will be finer tomorrow: It is thundering
               and lightning fearfully. We are living at the <orgName key="6684">Actien-hotel</orgName>. Very dear and not particularly good. The storm is
               fearful. The rolling of the thunder is almost uninterrupted. As we were very late in
               starting from <placeName key="49069">Hamburg</placeName>
               <persName key="856">aunt Lulu&#x2019;s</persName> hatbox chose the very minute when we were
               taring madly along the platform for letting it&#x2019;s bottom come out so that we had to
               rush on one with the hat the ribbons streaming behind the other with the pieces of
               the hatbox to catch the train. Arrived here <persName key="856">aunt Lulu</persName>
               found that her ink bottle which she had put into her trunk had broken and made
               everything black; so she tried to mop it up with the hotel towel which did not do any
               good and only blackened the towel so that she had to sit up half the night washing it
               and had a grand fight with the hotel people who wanted to charge her for it. Then her
               &#x201e;réveil matin&#x201c; which she had set on 7.30 the next morning woke her at four at which
               time she got up and rung violently for the maid and abused her for not waking her as
               it was already nine. So we are living in violent strife with all the hotelpeople.
