      September 10. 1885.</p>
            <p>Got up early, but found weather too bad to go over to the D端ne; the
      waves are too large there. So we took a sailing boat at 8.30 and sailed out. It
      was beautiful, the waves being longer than yesterday and much higher, so that
      we could often not see the masts of the ships before us. We again had
      <persName key="1892">Kr端ss</persName>, and bargained to keep him till 12 for 4
      Thalers. His boat belongs to <persName key="81672">Professor Oppholtz</persName> of
      <placeName key="49451">Vienna</placeName>. We first came back at 10 and had a
      warm breakfast, and when we went out on the pier met <persName key="1894">the two
      Loppmanns</persName>, whom we offered to sail with us, which the accepted very
      willingly. We again went right out and got a good view of the German man of
      war. There are two english cutters, the Mermaid and Rose, in the Habour too.
      After dinner, which we again had at Bufes we wanted to
      go away by the Cuxhafen, but the weather was so bad it could not go.
      <persName key="856">Aunt Lulu</persName> was in a dreadful way about it. And
      it is very unpleasant. However we marched home again with all our luggage and
      then again sailed with <persName key="1895">Peter Friedrichs</persName> this time, and two
      other gentlemen. He went out much further than any of the others, and the waves
      were dilightful. But we soon had to come back on account of the wind, and I
      then went upstairs, read the papers in the Conversations Haus and had dinner
      there afterwards. <persName key="856">Aunt Lulu</persName> kept on going to
      sleep. <persName key="8568">Bismarck</persName> seems to be retreating before
      Spain. Please God not.</p>
